Welcome to the Third Party Tools (TPL) directory. This is where all the tools required
to import/export listings to and from Centralized Third Party Services (eBay, Amazon, etc).

This was inspired by a brief discussion at the OpenBazaar forums about "One-Click Decentralization",
which can be viewed at the link below:

Due to the upcoming Beta 1.0 release, issues requiring more immediate attention need to be fulfilled
first. Nevertheless, this sub-project is important enough in that it fulfills a function that
hastens the adoption of OpenBazaar, and decentralized commerce in general, that it will have continued development.

On the roadmap, we  currently have:

    * Import from eBay Listing button
        * initial pre-alpha structuring and code-structuring
        * Hopefully a proof-of-concept can be released by end of the year.
